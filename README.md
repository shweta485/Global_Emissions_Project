# Global_Emissions_Project

Methane is responsible for around 30% of the rise in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution,
and rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions are key to limiting near-term global warming and improving air quality.
The energy sector – including oil, natural gas, coal and bioenergy – accounts for nearly 40% of methane emissions from human activity.

The following dataset has information about methane gas emissions globally. Details about the columns are as follows:

region -
country - Country of Emission.
emissions - Methane Emissions in kt.
type - Sector from which emissions occur.
Segment- Sub-sector from which emissions occur.
reason - The reason for the emission.
baseYear - Base year for the tracking of emissions.
notes - The source of data

calculated the total methane emissions for the top 10 countries using the groupby() and sum() functions.
However, it would be helpful to convert the emissions values to a more readable format, such as kilotons (kt).

created a histogram to visualize the distribution of methane emissions using the plt.hist() function.
I used bar plots to visualize the total methane emissions by sector and region using the sns.barplot() and sns.boxplot() functions.
I created a pie chart to show the proportion of methane emissions by sector using the df.groupby().plot(kind='pie') function
I visualized the top 10 countries with the highest methane emissions using a bar plot.
I pivoted the dataset and created a stacked bar plot to show the distribution of methane emissions by sector and reason.
I used the Plotly Express library to create interactive sunburst and bar plots to analyze segment-wise methane emissions by region.

Developed and executed a comprehensive data science project on Global Emissions, aiming to analyze and mitigate environmental impact.
Utilized advanced data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms to process and model large datasets of emission data from various sources.
Employed statistical analysis to identify patterns, trends, and potential areas for emissions reduction.
Collaborated with a team of experts to design and implement actionable strategies for emission reduction based on the project's findings.
Presented findings and recommendations to stakeholders, including senior management and environmental organizations, to facilitate informed decision-making.
Demonstrated a strong understanding of environmental science, data analysis, and machine learning concepts while effectively leveraging programming skills to
drive meaningful change.
